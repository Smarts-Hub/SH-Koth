# Schedulers use the cron format to define the times when the koths will be started.
# You can add to the list as many times as you want, with the same or different koths.
# Cron format: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week
# Interactive web to create cron expressions: https://crontab.guru/
# Examples:
schedulers:
  evening_event:
    times:
    # Every day at 18:00 and every Friday at 20:30
      - "0 18 * * *"
      - "30 20 * * 5"

    # random: if true, only one koth from the list will be chosen randomly
    # if false, all koths from the list will be started
    random: false

    # List of koths to start at the specified times (ids defined in koths folder)
    koths:
      - "arena1"
      - "arena2"

  # Every day at midnight, one random koth from the list
  midnight_random:
    times:
      - "0 0 * * *"
    random: true
